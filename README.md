The virus as known as Covid-19 we are facing today has created many problems. 
One of these problems is experienced in education. Due to the pandemic caused by the virus, many students around the world receive inadequate education. 
Because of Covid-19 , schools for more than 168 million children globally have been closed for almost a full year . 
This study focuses on this problem regionally. Our aim in this study is to examine the students affected by the pandemic in different regions and provide information.
