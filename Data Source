In this study , I used Unicef datas .

These datas include :
      
      - Number of students effected when schools are "Fully Closed"
      - Number of students effected when schools are "Partially Closed"
      - Number of students effected when schools are "Fully Open"
      - Percentage of students with internet access at home "Rural"
      - Percentage of students with internet access at home "Urban"
      
I did not have any difficulty collecting and using these data. Because, these datas are created regularly by Unicef .
