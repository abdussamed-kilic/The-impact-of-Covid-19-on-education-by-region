In this study , I used Unicef datas . We did not collect this data from the same dataset. We have
gathered the datas we will use in parts from different data sets and created the final dataset. While
collecting these datas , we took the same categories into consideration. For example , based on
“regions”.

These datas include :
      
      - Number of students effected when schools are "Fully Closed"
      - Number of students effected when schools are "Partially Closed"
      - Number of students effected when schools are "Fully Open"
      - Percentage of students with internet access at home "Rural"
      - Percentage of students with internet access at home "Urban"
      
I did not have any difficulty collecting and using these data. Because, these datas are created regularly by Unicef .
